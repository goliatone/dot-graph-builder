## Dot Graph Builder

Create graph diagrams using javascript and render using [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org).

It contains a CLI utility to generate **.dot** files as well as output graphics in other formats such as **png** or **pdf**.

To get started:

```
$ npm i dot-graph-builder
```

Install dependency on mac using Homebrew:

```
$ brew install graphviz
```

**NOTE** I'm using this library to create class diagrams for Waterline models including their relationships.
